# NCDR LAAO Data Engineering Jupyter Notebook
This repository contains a Jupyter notebooks on the data engineering process for merging NCDR LAAO extracts of version 1.3 and 1.4 and how write to delta tables in a warehouse. 

Python, Apache Spark, and the Fabric data ecosystem were used in creating this project.

This project shows the data engineering process for merging NCDR LAAO extracts of version 1.3 and 1.4 and how to write to delta tables in a warehouse.

LAAO procedures are newer procedures and an emerging medtech field. The procedure seeks to reduce the risk of stroke and need for long term medications in patients with the heart arrhythmia known as Atrial Fibrillation. The data in this project contains pre-operative, intra-operative, post-operative and long term follow up details on the procedure that allow teams to better understand treatment modalities and how to improve outcomes in this patient population.
